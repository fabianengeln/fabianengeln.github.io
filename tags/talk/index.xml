      <description>The search conference The Mix-Camp E-Commerce search is an &amp;ldquo;informal one-day event to bring together experts of different backgrounds - such as IT, product managers, UX designers, search managers, information retrieval specialists, data scientists, search engine vendors - to discuss challenges, ideas, best practices, and case studies in the e-commerce search domain.&amp;rdquo; (see: MICES).
